# Automatic-detection-of-retinal-blood-vessels-using-Matlab-Gui-and-CVIP-tools
* I make a GUI for the detection of retinal blood vessel segmentation. The user can give any fundus retinal image and can see the step by step process to get the desired segmentation results.
# Use the step to run the algorithm
* Run the project.retina.m file
* Run the projett.retina.gui file
* You can download the image from https://www5.cs.fau.de/research/data/fundus-images/
* For analysing the result I used CVIP tools. You acn find it on https://cviptools.ece.siue.edu/
